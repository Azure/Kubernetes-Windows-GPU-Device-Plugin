# Example Job for running an Intel Quick Sync transcode operation with FFmpeg inside a container
# 
# NOTE: this Job will only work when the device allocated by the WDDM device plugin is an Intel GPU,
# otherwise the DLL files for Quick Sync won't exist and FFmpeg will fail when it tries to load them.
