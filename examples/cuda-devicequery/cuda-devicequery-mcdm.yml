# Example Job for running the CUDA deviceQuery sample program inside a container
# 
# This version of the Job requests a compute-only device from the MCDM device plugin. For a version that
# requests a display device from the WDDM device plugin, see the file `cuda-devicequery-wddm.yml`
# 
# NOTE: this Job will only work when the device allocated by the MCDM device plugin is an NVIDIA GPU,
# otherwise the DLL files required by `deviceQuery.exe` won't exist and the Pod will fail to start.
