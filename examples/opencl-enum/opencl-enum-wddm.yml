# Example Job for running the OpenCL enumopencl sample program inside a container
# 
# This version of the Job requests a display device from the WDDM device plugin. For a version that
# requests a compute-only device from the MCDM device plugin, see the file `opencl-enum-mcdm.yml`
# 
# NOTE: this Job will only work when the device allocated by the WDDM device plugin is is a GPU that supports
# OpenCL, otherwise the DLL files required by `enumopencl.exe` won't exist and the Pod will fail to start.
